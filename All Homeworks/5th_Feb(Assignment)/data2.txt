Sorry I laughed so hard my brain filed a police complaint.
My mouth said innocent but my laugh hired a lawyer.
My chair fainted, my fan clapped, and my notebook started a podcast.
Even my calculator shouted bro this is undefined behavior.
My pillow promoted me to clown, my dog gave me zero marks, and my mirror nominated me for comedy Nobel.
I apologized to the universe, but gravity sent me a laughing emoji and charged extra weight for jokes.
Now my soul sells tickets, my brain sells popcorn, and my life streams this apology in HD very loud today.
